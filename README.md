cd viggy
```
Install required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Configure the bot token (configuration guide below), and start the bot

python ./main.py
```

### Configuration guide
The configuration is just a simple toml file, all you have to do is copy `config.toml.sample` into `config.toml`, and then add the bot token to the `token` key under the `[discord]` table.

Example:
```toml
[discord]
token = "MjEzMjkwMTY3NDA5MTgwNjcy.8JFhmK.nMMfj8laiN6kknmbPIEtrfr4nk99_4rEDxles"
```
(token for demonstration purposes, it isn't real)
